# Screenshots for Apps Catalog

For **Apps Catalog** submission, add at least one screenshot taken with **qFlipper**:

1. Run the app on your Flipper Zero.
2. In qFlipper, use the screenshot feature to capture the game screen.
3. Save the image here as `ss0.png` (do not change resolution or format).

The first screenshot (`ss0.png`) is used as the app preview in the catalog.
